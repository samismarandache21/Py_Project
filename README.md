🐍 Py_Project – Modular Python Application
🔹 A structured Python application built on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

🚀 Why This Project?
✅ Modular Architecture – Clearly separated components for better maintainability
✅ OOP Principles – Encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction for cleaner code
✅ User Interaction (CLI-based UI) – Simple and intuitive user interface
✅ Validation System – Ensures data integrity through a validation module
✅ Data Persistence – Efficient file-based storage management

🛠️ Technologies & Methodologies Used
Technology/Methodology	Purpose
🐍 Python	Core programming language
🏗️ OOP Principles	Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
🧪 Validation System	Ensures data integrity
🗂️ File Handling	Stores and manages data in local files
🎯 Project Features
🔹 1. Modular Architecture
Separation of Concerns: The project is divided into modules like domain, repository, service, validator, and UI.
Scalability: The modular approach allows easy extension of functionalities.
🔹 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Encapsulation: Data is managed securely within dedicated classes.
Abstraction: Hides unnecessary details and provides clean interfaces.
Inheritance: Common behaviors are reused across different classes.
🔹 3. User Interaction (CLI-based UI)
Simple and Intuitive: The UI module handles all user interactions via the command line.
Menu Navigation: Users can interact with the system smoothly.
🔹 4. Data Validation & Persistence
Validation Module: Ensures correct data inputs.
File Storage: Uses repository to handle data storage in files.
